         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>But a moſt probable argument of the future tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the Provinces under the Chriſtian King, may be concluded from the unexpected returne of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> forces, which lay fortified in <hi>Guyenne,</hi> into their own land. The laſt yeere they invaded that Province with all their might, got into their poſſeſſion <hi>Bordegain, Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure,</hi>
                  <pb n="132" facs="tcp:7472:74"/>Saint <hi>John de Luz,</hi> and ſome other ſmall places, fortified them with retrenchments, horn-works, half<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moons, Cullion-heads, and other like works of that na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; all which were manifeſt evidences, that they in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to hold what they had gotten by the ſword, and fortune of warre; yet this yeere, <hi>September</hi> 15/25, no man aſſaulting them, no Army appearing in field againſt them, (as the <hi>French</hi> do relate) upon a bare report, that the Duke <hi>de Valette,</hi> following the Kings direction, was comming againſt them with all his troops, the Duke of <hi>Nocera</hi> their Generall, cauſed them to leave their places of ſtrength, and to return with him homeward. The cauſes of this their ſudden departure are related diverſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſome aſcribe it to the frequent incurſions of the <hi>Bay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onnois,</hi> into <hi>Spain,</hi> and the Frontiers of <hi>Navarre,</hi> from whence they never returned empty of pillage, horſes, beefs, and ſuch other booty, the inhabitants there being unable to make any head againſt them. Others to the neceſſity of the Catholike Kings Dominions, which by the rage of plague and peſtilence, had their Garriſons ſo abated, that the remaynder of the preſidiaries therin, was not able to mayntain them: eſpecially in <hi>Navarre</hi> and <hi>Pampelona,</hi> which were ſo depopulated by theſe maledies (eſpecially by the purple) that theſe Conque<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours could not expect any ſuccours thence, were they never ſo diſtreſſed: other to a Panick feare, cauſed by a three dayes continued fight of two Eagles in the Aire, which being not determined without the death of one of them, made the ſuperſtitious people entertain hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid conceits of direfull and terrible conſequents. But this of all the reſt is moſt improbable, and ſo farre from having any ſemblances with truth, that it cannot be thought a concurrent, much leſſe the adequate cauſe of the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Dukes ſudden departure. An heroick heart is not affrighted with prodigies, and yet the fight of the
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:7472:74"/>Eagles, birds of prey cannot be accounted ſuch, Doves ſuppoſed by antiquity to be made up without gall, upon the choice of a mate have done the like, and then it is not to be wondred if theſe royall inhabitants of the aire, ſhall entertain ſo ſharp a conflict. The moſt likely cauſes were theſe two, firſt feare of impendent want of victuals, which though they yet felt not, leaving two houſes filled with bisket at <hi>Ciboure,</hi> yet they had cauſe to imagine, muſt neceſſary ſoone over take them, their friends were not able to relieve them; nor could they get them in the King in <hi>France</hi> his Dominion, the Duke of <hi>Valette,</hi> having by order from his Majeſty raiſed three ſtrong Forts upon the adventues of their inrodes, the one at <hi>Eſpelette,</hi> the ſecond at Saint <hi>Pe.</hi> and the third at <hi>Biariz</hi> upon the Sea ſide betwixt them and <hi>Bayonne,</hi> which ſecured that Province from their incurſions. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly an Epidemicall diſeaſe, called by them in their own languages <hi>Tavardillos, i.</hi> a peſtilent ſpotted Fever, ſo raging amongſt them, that it had ſwept away already 8000 men of the Dukes Army, by both which they were made ſenſible of that loſſe, which made them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſh their holds in <hi>Guienne,</hi> wherof they had foure within one league, <hi>viz. &amp; Bordegain, &amp; la Carriere</hi> (where they had rayſed a Fort-royall) <hi>Socova</hi> and <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boure,</hi> and their Fortifications about <hi>Orogne</hi> and <hi>Han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daye,</hi> where not without great expenſe, they had made a circumvallation, able to contain two thouſand men: much regret and unwillingneſſe, as may be more then collected, by thoſe three Eſcripts, left (as the <hi>French</hi> ſay) behinde them, and found after their departure.</p>
